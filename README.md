Final Project - Game Center

This project is a collection of six interactive games, built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The main window acts as a central hub from which you can navigate to individual landing pages for each game. The project showcases a combination of classic games, all neatly integrated into a single application.

Games Included:
Battle Shooter – A space-themed shooter where you battle against alien ships.
Tic-Tac-Toe – The classic game where you compete against an AI opponent.
Snakes and Ladders – A virtual version of the well-known board game.
Math Game – Solve math problems, but get disqualified if the answer is incorrect.
TO-DO List Application – Manage your tasks with the ability to create, update, and delete tasks.
Country List Project – Fetch country information such as population, flag, and currency through an API.


Features:
Main Window: The Game Center serves as the central hub, with links to landing pages for each game.
Dynamic Game Interactions: Games are interactive, and several include score tracking and difficulty settings.
Beautiful Design: The UI was designed with a light brown and cream color palette, with consistent and user-friendly design principles.
External Resources: This project uses external images and assets (listed below) to enhance the user experience.
